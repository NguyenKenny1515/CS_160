        <h2>The Objective</h2>
        <p>
            The purpose of this project is to develop an online platform of a
            recreation system for a smart city, which will help citizens
            choose various activities for them or their children. Their
            choice will be made based on various criteria, such as age
            (for example preschool, grades 9-12, adults, seniors), type of
            activity (for example sports, arts), proximity to the venue
            (for example at a distance of up to 5 miles), its cost, dates
            and time, etc.
        </p>

        <h2>What you'll need</h2>
        <li>An Account</li>
        <li> Credit Card</li>
        <li>10 minutes</li>

        <h3>How it works</h3>
        <p>
            The platform will allow users to purchase points (robucks) for the
            activity they are interested in registering for with the use of their credit card. This purchase of points
            will act as an electronic wallet that will fund the events for which the person wishes to sign up for.
        </p>

        <div>&nbsp;</div>

        <p>The users can view more information about the event organizers as well as the activities themselves by hovering
            over them, view their payment information when registering for an event, and browse the map to view events
            nearby.
        </p>

      <p>If the user doesn't feel like creating an account, that's completely fine as well! Those who want to simply browse events
            but not register may click the 'Explore Events' tab in the navigation bar.
